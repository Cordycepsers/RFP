## GitHub Actions Fix Summary

### Problem Identified
- GitHub Actions workflows were failing with error: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`"
- The deprecated action was causing automatic workflow failures since v3 was sunset by GitHub

### Changes Made

#### Fixed Deprecated Actions
1. **monitor.yml** - Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `@v4`
2. **monitor.yml** - Updated `actions/cache@v3` → `@v4` 

#### Standardized All Action Versions
3. **monitor.yml** - Updated `actions/setup-python@v4` → `@v5`
4. **ci.yml** - Updated `actions/setup-python@v4` → `@v5`

### Current Action Versions (All Latest Stable)
- `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/setup-python@v5` 
- `actions/cache@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### Testing the Fix
The fix can be verified in the following ways:

1. **Manual Trigger** (Immediate):
   - Go to https://github.com/Cordycepsers/RFP_monitor/actions
   - Select "Proposaland Opportunity Monitor" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button to manually trigger

2. **Automatic Trigger** (Daily):
   - The workflow runs automatically daily at 9:00 AM UTC
   - Next run will test the fix automatically

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Workflow should complete without the deprecation error
   - Artifacts should be uploaded successfully 
   - Monitoring results should be available for download

### Additional Benefits
- All workflows now use latest stable action versions
- Future-proofed against upcoming deprecations
- Consistent action versions across all workflow files
- Better performance and security from latest action versions

The fix is minimal and surgical - only updating version numbers while preserving all existing functionality.
