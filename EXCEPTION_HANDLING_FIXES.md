# World Bank Scraper Exception Handling Fixes

## Summary

Fixed broad exception handling in both World Bank scrapers to improve error visibility, debugging capabilities, and system reliability.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/advanced_scrapers/worldbank_advanced_scraper.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Broad `except Exception` catches that masked specific errors
- Missing specific Playwright exception handling
- Poor error logging that didn't distinguish between different error types

**Changes Made:**
- Added specific Playwright exception imports:
  ```python
  from playwright.sync_api import Error as PlaywrightError, TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError
  ```
- Replaced broad exception handling in row processing loop:
  ```python
  except PlaywrightError as pe:
      logger.warning(f"Playwright error processing World Bank row: {pe}")
      continue
  except PlaywrightTimeoutError as te:
      logger.warning(f"Timeout error processing World Bank row: {te}")
      continue
  except Exception as e:
      logger.warning(f"Unexpected error processing World Bank row: {e}")
      continue
  ```
- Improved main scraping exception handling:
  ```python
  except PlaywrightError as pe:
      logger.error(f"Playwright error during World Bank scraping: {pe}")
  except PlaywrightTimeoutError as te:
      logger.error(f"Timeout error during World Bank scraping: {te}")
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Unexpected error during World Bank scraping: {e}")
      raise  # Re-raise unexpected exceptions for debugging
  ```

### 2. `/src/scrapers/worldbank_scraper.py`

**Issues Fixed:**
- Broad exception handling that could mask network issues, JSON parsing errors, and data processing errors
- Generic error messages that didn't help with troubleshooting
- Date parsing exceptions not properly categorized

**Changes Made:**
- Added specific request exception imports:
  ```python
  from requests.exceptions import RequestException, Timeout, ConnectionError, HTTPError
  ```
- Improved API request exception handling:
  ```python
  except Timeout as te:
      self.logger.error(f"Timeout error fetching World Bank data: {te}")
      break
  except ConnectionError as ce:
      self.logger.error(f"Connection error with World Bank API: {ce}")
      break
  except HTTPError as he:
      self.logger.error(f"HTTP error from World Bank API: {he}")
      break
  except RequestException as re:
      self.logger.error(f"Request error with World Bank API: {re}")
      break
  except ValueError as ve:
      self.logger.error(f"JSON parsing error for World Bank data: {ve}")
      break
  ```
- Enhanced main scraping exception handling:
  ```python
  except RequestException as re:
      self.logger.error(f"Network error while scraping World Bank: {re}")
  except ValueError as ve:
      self.logger.error(f"Data processing error while scraping World Bank: {ve}")
  except Exception as e:
      self.logger.error(f"Unexpected error scraping World Bank: {e}")
      raise
  ```
- Improved date parsing exception handling:
  ```python
  except (ValueError, TypeError):
      # Common WB formats
      for fmt in ['%B %d, %Y', '%b %d, %Y', '%d-%b-%Y', '%Y-%m-%d']:
          try:
              opp.extracted_date = datetime.strptime(str(pub), fmt)
              break
          except (ValueError, TypeError):
              continue
  ```
- Enhanced data extraction exception handling:
  ```python
  except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError) as e:
      self.logger.debug(f"Error extracting World Bank API items: {e}")
  ```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `/tests/test_worldbank_exception_handling.py` that verifies:
- Timeout exception handling
- Connection error handling  
- JSON parsing error handling
- Data mapping error handling
- Playwright-specific exception handling
- Logging configuration

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Specific exception types provide clearer insight into failure causes
2. **Improved Reliability**: Appropriate handling prevents system crashes while maintaining visibility
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Different log levels and messages help with operational monitoring
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Network issues don't crash the entire scraping process

## Additional Issues Identified

The codebase has widespread use of broad `except Exception` handling across many files:

### High Priority Files to Fix:
- `src/advanced_scrapers/devex_playwright_scraper.py` (9 occurrences)
- `src/scrapers/afdb_scraper.py` (14 occurrences)
- `src/advanced_scrapers/base_advanced_scraper.py` (10 occurrences)
- `src/notifications/email_notifier.py` (5 occurrences)
- `src/outputs/gdrive_integration.py` (12 occurrences)

### Common Exception Types to Handle Specifically:
- **Network/HTTP**: `RequestException`, `Timeout`, `ConnectionError`, `HTTPError`
- **Data Processing**: `ValueError`, `KeyError`, `TypeError`, `AttributeError`
- **Playwright**: `PlaywrightError`, `TimeoutError`
- **File Operations**: `IOError`, `OSError`, `PermissionError`
- **JSON/XML**: `JSONDecodeError`, `XMLSyntaxError`

## Recommendations

1. **Systematic Review**: Review all scrapers using the same pattern applied to World Bank scrapers
2. **Standard Exception Patterns**: Create base exception handling patterns for different operation types
3. **Logging Standards**: Establish consistent logging levels and message formats
4. **Error Recovery**: Implement proper retry logic for transient failures
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics collection for different exception types

## Usage

The fixed scrapers now provide:
- More informative error messages in logs
- Better separation between expected/recoverable errors and unexpected failures
- Improved debugging capabilities through specific exception handling
- Maintained system stability while improving observability

Both scrapers pass syntax validation and include proper error handling patterns that can be applied throughout the rest of the codebase.
